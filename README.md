## Use Cases

1. Creating examples for the LLM Code Materializer
2. Documenting existing projects
3. Sharing project structures
4. Creating templates for new projects
5. Backing up project structure and contents

## Notes

- The output file can be directly used with the LLM Code Materializer
- File contents are preserved exactly as they are
- Directory structure is maintained
- Python files are marked with proper syntax highlighting
- Special files (like map.txt) are included in plain code blocks

## Next Steps for Development

- Add support for more file types
- Include configuration file for customization
- Add filtering options for files and directories
- Support for preserving file permissions
- Add options for different output formats
